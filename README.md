# `ehttpd`
Welcome to `ehttpd` ðŸŽ‰

`ehttpd` is a thread-based HTTP server library, which can be used to create custom HTTP server applications.


## Thread-based design
The rationale behind the thread-based approach is that it is much easier to implement than `async/await`, subsequently
requires less code, and is â€“ in theory â€“ less error prone.

Furthermore, it also simplifies application development since the developer cannot accidentally stall the entire runtime
with a single blocking call â€“ managed by the OS-scheduler, threads offer much stronger concurrency isolation guarantees
(which can even be `nice`d or tweaked in most environments if desired).


## Performance
While the thread-based approach is not the most efficient out there, it's not that bad either. Some `wrk` benchmarks:

### MacBook Pro (`M1 Pro`, `helloworld`, `v0.7.1`)
