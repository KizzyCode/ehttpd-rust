# `ehttpd`
Welcome to `ehttpd` ðŸŽ‰

`ehttpd` is a thread-based HTTP server library, which can be used to create custom HTTP server applications.


## Thread-based design
The rationale behind the thread-based approach is that it is much easier to implement than `async/await`, subsequently requires less codes and is â€“ in theory â€“ less error prone. Furthermore, it also simplifies application development since
the developer doesn't cannot accidentally stall the entire runtime with a single blocking call.


## Performance
While the thread-based approach is not the most efficient out there, it's not that bad either. Some `wrk` benchmarks:

### MacBook Pro (`M1 Pro`, `helloworld`)
```ignore
$ wrk -t 64 -c 64 http://localhost:9999/testolope
Running 10s test @ http://localhost:9999/testolope
